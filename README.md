# Go Programming Toolchain Installation Script for Linux

This is a semi-automated script for installing and updating the basic Go programming tools for Linux systems.

**Supported Platforms and Architectures**

- Linux amd64

**Supported Shells**

- Bash

**Supported Installation Paths**

By default, `go-toolchain-install.sh` supports the Go recommended installation directory (`/usr/local/go`) for a system-wide configuration. But you also have the option to choose a local installation for the current user only (`~/.local/share/go`).

`go-toolchain-update.sh` is able to update the Go toolchain in different directories; however, if you installed it using root or `sudo` to a directory other than `/usr/local/go`, the update may fail. To circumvent this, run the script as root or with `sudo`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your computer.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/szageda/go-toolchain-install-linux.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned directory.

```shell
cd go-toolchain-install-linux
```

3. Make the scripts executable.

```shell
chmod +x *.sh
```

4. Run the script of your choice:

    - If you want to install the Go programming tools:

    ```shell
    ./go-env-install.sh
    ```
    - If you want update the already installed Go programming tools:

    ```shell
    ./go-env-update.sh
    ```
